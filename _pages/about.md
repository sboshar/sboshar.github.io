<h2>about me</h2  >

I am a research engineer @ <a href="https://www.instadeep.com/">InstaDeep</a> (now <a href="https://www.biontech.com/int/en/home.html">BioNTech</a>), where I work on developing generative foundation models for genomics <i class="fa-solid fa-dna"></i> . This work builds on my masters <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156816?show=full">thesis</a> where I studied LLMS <i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i> as unified approach to model genomics and proteomics. 

I earned my undergraduate at MIT where I double majored in Computer Science <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i> and Math and minored in Brain and Cognitive Sciences <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i>. 

I am most passionate about applying skills in computer science, math, and machine learning to solve otherwise intractable problems and to find interpretable explanations for complex systems.
